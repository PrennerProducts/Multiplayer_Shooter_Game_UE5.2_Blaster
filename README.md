## Setup and Installation (comming soon)

Thank you for your interest in my Online Shooter Game with Unreal Engine 5! Please note that the game is currently in active development, and I am excited to invite testers to help me improve the game.

To get started, follow these steps (Beta coming soon):

1. Download the contents of the "Build" folder from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrennerProducts/Multiplayer_Shooter_Game_UE5.2_Blaster) to your local computer.
2. Ensure that you have the Steam client installed and running on your computer. Make sure that your Steam download region is set to Europe.
3. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the game files, specifically the "Blaster.exe" executable.
4. Launch the "Blaster.exe" executable. The game will start, and you will be in the lobby.
5. You now can host a GameSession or Join a GameSession.
6. The game will wait for at least two online players to join the lobby before starting the gameplay.

Please note that this version is still in development, and there may be bugs or incomplete features. Your feedback during this testing phase is highly valuable to me as I work towards delivering an amazing Online Shooter experience.

If you encounter any issues or have questions during the setup or testing process, please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:lukas@lupre.at). Your support and feedback are crucial to the development of this game.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions as we work together to create an exciting Online Shooter!
